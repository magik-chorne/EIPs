## Simple Summary
A standard JSON schema for ERC-721 token metadata

## Abstract
Much of the information about owning an ERC-721 is stored on the blockchain. However - the "tokenURI" parameter is used to locate a file off-chain that stores any extra metadata that might be useful for wallets and marketplaces of ERC-721 assets. Proposed is a metadata standard that replaces EIP-1047. This new standard encompasses past use-cases while building in flexibility for any future as-yet-unknown use-case.

## Motivation
ERC-721s are becoming rapidly adopted across the blockchain community - however the metadata used across the community is becoming fractured at the same pace. This EIP is a direct attempt at addressing the current use-cases in a way that is broadly applicable while leaving enough flexibility to be useful long-term without much modification. This EIP also recognizes that marketplaces and wallets are being built around ERC-721s where their usage may be wildly different - from game assets to trading cards - physical and digital art to homes and mortgages. This metadata standard should be able to give wallets and marketplaces enough contextual info to display these assets correctly.

## Specification

The following lists the required parameters for any ERC-721 metadata file.

```json
{
  "label": "Name/Title/etc. of the object to be tokenized Ex: 'Mona Lisa' or 'Genesis Kitty'",
  "label_type": "Descriptor of what category the label is Ex: 'Title' or 'Name'",
  "issuer": "Who created the object OR who created the token - whichever is more relevant. Ex: 'Leonardo DaVinci' or 'Axiom Zen'",
  "issuer_type": "Descriptor of the type of entity that issued the object/token. Ex: 'Artist' or 'Company'",
  "type": "Classification of the object. Ex: 'Painting' 'Cryptokitty'"
}
```

The following lists the optional categories dependent upon relevance to the tokenized object. However if a parent category is used - all subcategories are required unless otherwise noted.

```json
{
  "description": "A short description of the object this token represents.",
  "platform": "Additional descriptor of what platform this token was created for. Ex: 'World of Warcraft' 'Facebook'",
  "attributes": {
  "OPTIONAL": "OPTIONAL: Attributes are a flexible space for adding additional metadata that isn't covered by the standard as written.",
  "OPTIONAL2": "OPTIONAL: How to parse attributes is determined from values in 'type' and optionally 'platform'."
  },
  "location": {
  "system": "Type of system used to describe the location. Ex: 'Cartesian' 'UTM' 'MGRS'",
  "coordinates": "Location in system specific coordinates."
  },
  "image": {
  "hash": "An IPFS-style hash of the image file that is associated with this token",
  "extension": "Filename extension of the image file",
  "URI": "OPTIONAL: Url of the object hosted on the traditional web"
  },
  "video": {
  "hash": "An IPFS-style hash of the video file that is associated with this token",
  "extension": "Filename extension of the video file",
  "URI": "OPTIONAL: Url of the object hosted on the traditional web"
  },
  "audio": {
  "hash": "An IPFS-style hash of the audio file that is associated with this token",
  "extension": "Filename extension of the audio file",
  "URI": "OPTIONAL: Url of the object hosted on the traditional web"
  },
  "3d": {
  "hash": "An IPFS-style hash of the 3d file that is associated with this token",
  "extension": "Filename extension of the 3d file",
  "URI": "OPTIONAL: Url of the object hosted on the traditional web"
  }
}
```
## Rationale
Of primary note are the addition of label_type, issuer_type, and the requirement of a hash for media files.

The reasoning for label_type and issuer_type is to allow for wallets and marketplaces to correctly display tokens without requiring any knowledge of their original source. For example - a wallet can display a token with the header "Name: Genesis Kitty" next to the token header "Title: Mona Lisa" without need additional contextual information. Similarly - issuer_type allows a wallet/marketplace to display a token with the header "Artist: Leonardo DaVinci" next to "Company: Axiom Zen". This will become more important as the range of tokenized assets grows.

The requirement of a hash for media files solves three problems. First - if an asset is (re)moved from its primary URI - this hash allows us to verify the authenticity of any duplicate media file that may be mirrored in another location. Second - we can use the hash to verify if the file located at the primary URI has changed. Third - the hash allows us to easily access the file via decentralized storage (i.e. IPFS) in the cases where peer-to-peer file transfers or fully-decentralized applications are valuable.

Of lesser note - "issuer" has become required, "attributes" was added (following the OpenSea model), and "type" was removed. "issuer"" is to help track the origin of the asset. Verification of the issuer, however, is still a difficulty and out of scope for this EIP. "attributes" allows for a flexible way to add useful information on a per-token basis that isn't covered in the rest of the standard. "type" was removed because that information is largely implicit.

## Backwards Compatibility
This is not backwards compatible with EIP-1047.
